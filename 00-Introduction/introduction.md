# What is HTML?
<strong>In the most simple explanation, HTML adds elements (i.e. videos, images, text, GIFs, etc.) to a webpage. Which also means you can make your first website today!</strong><br>
Instead of trying to explain more detailed concepts here, let's learn by getting your hands on your keyboard and write our first line of code!

First go to 'Extensions', type 'Live Preview' and press 'Install'. <br>
Using 'Live Preview' helps us to see what happens to a HTML webpage as soon as we make changes.
